<h1>The Stack</h1>
<p>In this assignment I will be outlining the 
        different parts of The Stack as outlined by Benjamin Bratton
        through 6 different images. You can view the images below: </p>
<h2>1: User</h2>

<p>In the first assignment I talked about how technology
    has desocialized us. In particular it has stripped kids 
    of the social skills that need to be fostered when they are young. 
</p>
<h2>2: Interface</h2>

<p>The Interface level shows the applications that children and 
    adults are generally using. While these applications can have positive impacts
    they are also consistently used for scamming, cyber-bullying and time-wasting. 
</p>
<h2>3: Address</h2>

<p>The address level goes into how individuals are able to actively
    use all of the apps on their smartphones and gadgets. Generally this is 
    achieved through their home wifi or through data covered by your cellphone plan.
</p>
<h2>4: City</h2>

 <p>The City level goes into all of the other people around you that are additionally 
     on their phones around you on the same servers and data services that you are using. 
 </p>
 <h2>5: Cloud</h2>
 <img src="https://tr4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/09/16/f39bcc82-aa71-4eb6-853c-033160ebfac6/resize/1200x/8a1991394ad4cede464a18781a302a61/data-center.jpg" width="310" height="245"/>
 <p>In the cloud layer all of the data from the moment in which you are on your phone 
     is data compiled from data centers across the world. 
 </p>
 <h2>6: Earth</h2>
 <img src="https://www.phocuswire.com/uploadedimages/uploads/2017/06/GA-JUN17-conversant.jpg?width=600&height=300&scale=both&mode=crop" width="310" height="245"/>
 <p>In the Earth layer are all of the individuals that are on their phones instead of spending time with their families. The positive and negative impacts of technology
     go hand in hand. Although you are able to keep in touch with people thousands of miles away and are able to 
     learn and have so much at your fingertips, it is difficult to prevent ourselves from spending too much time on our devices and taking away from the real interactions that 
     make life worth living.
